# 🍄 Poisonous vs. Non-Poisonous Mushroom Classification

Supervised Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as poisonous or non-poisonous based on their physical characteristics. The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple classification models to determine which approach provides the most accurate and reliable predictions.

Mushroom classification represents a high-stakes safety-critical task, where incorrect predictions can result in severe health consequences. As such, it provides a strong benchmark for evaluating classification models, comparing modeling approaches, and assessing performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Objectives

Clean and prepare structured tabular data for machine learning

Train multiple supervised classification models

Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics

Compare models to identify the best performer

Demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow suitable for production pipelines
